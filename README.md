In order to be able to get results from Fitbit API, you need to register your own app and update the Settings with your own Client ID, Client Secret and user ID.

You can find your user ID by logging into your account and clicking to your avatar to view your profile. The URL should read https://www.fitbit.com/user/XXXXXX, where XXXXXX is your user ID.
